when the webpage is rendered in a browser. The primary purpose of comments is to help developers understand the 
structure, purpose, or functionality of specific sections of code. Comments are ignored by browsers and are solely 
intended for human readability.
In HTML, comments are created using the <!-- and --> tags. Anything between these tags will be treated as a comment
and will not be displayed on the webpage. comments are used to provide information about the purpose of the heading, the paragraph, and the list within the HTML document. These comments can be helpful for developers who may be working on the code, as they offer insights into the structure and content of the webpage.
Keep in mind that when you view this page in a browser, the comments will not be visible on the rendered webpage.
