QNO 4: Write a Short Note On Tag & Elements ? In HTML, tags and elements are fundamental concepts used to structure and 
define the content of a webpage. Tag: A tag is a piece of code that represents an HTML element. Tags are used to define 
and enclose different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc. Tags are typically written 
with angle brackets, and they come in pairs â€“ an opening tag and a closing tag. Opening tags are used to begin an element,
 and closing tags are used to end it. Element: An element is formed by the combination of an opening tag, content, and a 
closing tag. Elements represent the building blocks of an HTML document, defining the structure and content of the webpage.
