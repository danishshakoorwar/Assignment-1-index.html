A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square image or icon associated with a website. It is displayed 
in the browser's address bar or tabs and is used as a visual representation of the website. Favicon helps users easily identify
 and locate a particular website among their open tabs or bookmarks.

Illustrative Example:

Let's say you have a website named "ExploreKashmir.com," and you want to create a favicon for it. The favicon is often a 
simplified version of your logo or a distinctive symbol associated with your brand. Here's an example:

Create a Favicon Image:

Size: 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels (square dimensions)
Format: ICO (though PNG and GIF are also supported by modern browsers)
Design your Favicon:

Considering the theme of your website, you might design a simple icon that represents Kashmir. It could be a stylized 
snow-capped mountain, a shikara boat, or any symbol that resonates with your content.
Save the Image:

Save your designed favicon with an appropriate name, like "favicon.ico."
Link Favicon in HTML:

In the <head> section of your HTML document, add a link tag to reference the favicon file.
