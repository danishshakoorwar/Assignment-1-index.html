Qno2 : What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities ?
Ans: HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters and symbols in HTML. They are particularly useful when you need to display characters that have a special meaning in HTML or when you want to represent characters that are not easily typable with a keyboard. Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&lt; - Less Than Sign (<):

Represents the less than symbol (<). Used to display the less than sign without starting an HTML tag.
&gt; - Greater Than Sign (>):

Represents the greater than symbol (>). Used to display the greater than sign without ending an HTML tag.
&amp; - Ampersand (&):

Represents the ampersand symbol (&). Used to display the ampersand without starting an HTML entity.
&quot; - Double Quotation Mark ("):

Represents the double quotation mark ("). Used to display double quotation marks within an attribute value.
&copy; - Copyright Symbol (©):

Represents the copyright symbol (©). Used to display the copyright symbol.
These entities are essential for avoiding conflicts with HTML syntax and ensuring that the browser correctly interprets
and displays the desired characters. There are many other HTML entities available for a wide range of characters and symbols.
