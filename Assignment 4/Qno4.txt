Qno4 :List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML?

Improving the accessibility of HTML involves implementing practices and techniques that make web content more usable for people with disabilities. Here are three key ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

Use Semantic HTML Elements:

Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the structure and content of a webpage. Using appropriate tags helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the hierarchy and purpose of content. For example:
Use <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> to define the structure of your page.
Use <h1> to <h6> for heading levels in a hierarchical order.
Provide Alternative Text for Images:

For images, use the alt attribute to provide descriptive alternative text. This text is read by screen readers to convey the 
content and purpose of the image to users with visual impairments. If an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey important 
information, use an empty alt attribute (alt="") to indicate it as such.


<img src="example.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:

Many users with disabilities rely on keyboards or other input devices instead of a mouse. Ensure that all interactive elements 
on your page, such as links and form controls, are accessible via keyboard navigation. Test your website using the "tab" key 
to navigate through links and form fields. Additionally, avoid relying on mouse-only events like onmouseover or onclick without
providing keyboard equivalents.

<!-- Example of a clickable element with keyboard support -->
<a href="example.html" role="button" tabindex="0">Click me</a>

These practices not only improve accessibility for users with disabilities but also contribute to creating a more structured,
understandable, and user-friendly experience for all visitors to your website. Always consider the diverse needs of your 
audience when developing web content and strive to make it as inclusive as possible.
